# WHAT THE CAT?!

Joke "virus" that spams with cat images (and not only cats).

This repo contains builder. In it you can change API with images and add some extra files to open them on start.

As out result you'll get .NET Framework 4.8 assembly as `.exe` file. When you open it, your desktop will be overflowed with cats images (or images from API passed in builder).

And that's it, enjoy!
