# WHAT THE CAT?!

Joke "virus" that spams with cat images (and not only cats).

Think this is a remake for [this thing](https://github.com/DeadLaurin/femboy-flooder), but on C#, with *"endless"* image display and there is cats rather than these guys. 

This repo contains builder. In it you can change API with images and limits.

As out result you'll get .NET Framework 4.8 assembly as `.exe` file. When you open it, your screen will be overflowed with cats images (or images from API passed in builder) until limit wasn't reached (or until PC reboot).

And that's it, enjoy!
